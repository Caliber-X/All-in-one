I\r\n'm familiar with Shimajiro (laughs) My daughter doesn't seem to have a special attachment to cars, but there are surprisingly many girls who like cars, so I recommend it as a gift as a trial.","4":"My grandson's Xmas gift When I was looking for it while worrying, I found a Plarail product at a 30% discount and purchased it immediately.\r\nHe was very pleased.\r\nIt was good to have a quick response.","5":"My son's Christmas gift had a\r\nlot of purchase points, so it was expensive, but is it easy to deduct it?\r\nI'm looking forward to it because I haven't given it yet.","6":"I bought it as a Christmas present for my 2-year-old son.

Children also touch Mickey's hands as if they were worried.","11":"My cousin's husband died and was lonely, but he said he would be healed by the talking doll I had, so I bought it as a gift.","12":"I gave it to my 94-year-old mother-in-law.\r\nI had a bad leg and was sitting in a chair at home to\r\nspend some free time, but when I grabbed my hand, he talked to me and I was confused at first\r\n, but I got used to it a little and enjoyed it quite a bit.","13":"After the review below, Neruru's words did not stop again, and I contacted the manufacturer's customer center by phone in that state. Then, they responded very politely and immediately checked the stock and replaced it with a new one. The new product will be delivered by the courier, so please hand over the Neruru that seems to be out of order. After all, I was happy that I was a Japanese manufacturer at such times. Therefore, the number of stars has increased to four. * I have Neruru at the time of its release, but compared to that, the number of words has increased, but the quality of the voice has deteriorated. Well, I think the quality of the voice is a matter of taste, so I think it can't be helped. I understand that it has become more human, but I feel that the tension is low, and I feel that the old Neruru and similar products of other companies have a very lovely voice. I also feel that the material of the face has become cheaper. My ears have become stiff and I feel like I'm approaching an artificial object. I think it's an initial failure, but once I started talking the same conversation repeatedly, I couldn't stop. It was troublesome to get the manufacturer to handle it, so I had no choice but to remove and reinsert the battery. I'm just a member of my family, so I'm living side by side like my twins with Neruru. If you drive with two people in the car, they will react to the vibration and continue to talk like a toddler, making long-distance driving fun.","14":"It was good that it arrived early, but it didn't work even if I put the batteries in, so I returned it.\r\nPerhaps it is a defective product to buy on this site. I don't want to order from this site again.\r\nI want you to inspect the product when you send it.","15":"Even if you insert the battery, it will not start, replace it with a new one, and then when you open and close your eyes, you will hear a noise, etc. Made in China!","16":"product has arrived.\r\nThank you very much.","17":"I plan to give it as one of my friends' baby gifts!\r\nI haven't given it yet, but it's so cute that I hope you'll be happy!","18":"I haven't opened it yet, but I was able to purchase it at a great deal with point back!\r\nAlso thank you.","19":"For birthday gifts for small 3 children.\r\nI was very happy.\r\nBut expensive \ufffd","20":"Difficult to get interested\r\nI bought it to get interested in the alphabet, but I loaded the alphabet blocks on the truck bed and I couldn't get any interest after that. There will be play such as attaching a string to the lower end of the driving car and pulling it around.","21":"The big helicopter made the children happy.","22":"Birthday gifts for grandchildren (requested products)\r\nLego has been around for a long time, and recently the hobby that meets the needs of the new era is compact and elaborate. I felt that the new colors were new.","23":"I asked him for his desired \"Lego\" as a birthday present for his grandson, a 9-year-old boy who loves railways. I was very pleased to call you right away. Thank you very much. I want you to play with \"Lego\" as much as you can because you can't go to school and you can't go anywhere.","24":"Children are happy too. It was also fun to make.","25":"I bought it as a birthday present.\r\nI wanted a lot, but it's out of stock ...\r\nsorry. .. I hope it will arrive again.","26":"I bought it as a birthday present.\r\nIt is said that it will compete with Plarail. I haven't opened it yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I wanted a lot of them all together, but I couldn't buy them because they were out of stock. Sorry. .. I hope it will arrive again.","27":"It is recommended that you do not throw away something like a stick with rails stacked and stopped. It won't fall apart when you put it away later. By the way, I think you probably need four sets to connect them in a circle \ufffd","28":"I chose this as a birthday present for my child.\r\nA son who loves Mario. I'm always playing with my sister on Switch, but I still can't do it well by myself.\r\nI learned that Mario appeared in my favorite Lego, and I had to buy this.\r\nHowever, the target age is over 6 years old. It's still early, but I bought it because my sisters said they would follow me.\r\nI assembled the delivered goods, my eldest daughter and myself to make a course. It took a while because there is no instruction manual, but it seems that you can do it immediately by downloading it online or looking at the app.\r\nWe are a group that wants to do something on our own, so we made it slowly and slowly while enjoying it.\r\nChibi who experienced the completed course was also very excited (* ? ? ? *) It was\r\nlike playing a game.\r\nSo I noticed. There are many other related products on sale, and you can do great things by combining them.\r\nI want them all!\r\nI think it's a very good toy that my sister bought (laughs), but the parts are so small that I'm likely to lose it.\r\nWe keep it in a zipper bag.\r\nAlso, be aware that homes with small babies are a bit dangerous.\r\nI'm already crazy about it. Lend me your sister too.\r\nMario requires two AAA batteries, so please have them ready.\r\nThe image is before and after inserting the battery. I wanted to post all the videos, so the image is rough, but if it helps.","29":"Thank you very much\r\nWe purchased for birthday of child. It was cheap and the packaging was clean, and it arrived immediately after ordering, which was very helpful. Thank you very much.

My daughter is also overjoyed.","38":"For girls in the lower grades of elementary school\r\nMy daughter in the third grade of elementary school chose and bought it. I bought it and assembled the bus in about 2 days. Then I am enjoying it with some modifications.","39":"It's worth making because it costs more than 10,000 yen. My daughter, who is in the third grade of elementary school, spent more than four hours silently making it by herself. It was a good time to refrain from doing so ^ ^ It was good that the shipment was quick.","40":"We are very satisfied with the response as soon as possible.\r\nThank you very much.","41":"I bought this for my daughter's Christmas gift.

I think the clear parts are used effectively and it is very nice.","55":"I bought it as a Christmas present for an older girl (requested by herself).\r\nThe parts were small and it seemed difficult to play alone, so it seems that they were assembled with their parents.\r\nIt is better to prepare a rearranging case so that the parts will not be scattered.","56":"We purchased for birthday presents. I think you will be pleased with the very good product.","57":"surprise! !!\r\nproduct has arrived! Surprise when opened! !! I was very impressed!\r\nAlso, at the time of sale, I was worried about the product that cost more than 20,000 yen for a while, but this time I am grateful that I was able to purchase a wonderful product at a low price here.

I liked the child and assembled it immediately. I want you to play for a long time.","69":"Tiny! Even children can't play because they can't put their fingers in it ... but I use it as a part of other LEGO. Olaf is cute, so it's ok.","70":"subtle. ..\r\nSince the product is very small, it is difficult to play even if you play pretend.\r\nWhen assembled, the part will come off immediately and collapse. I think the idea of ??making it a book type and easy to store is very good, but I would like it to be improved a little more.\r\nHe said that he shouldn't have bought his daughter because the castle would collapse with just a little touch.","71":"very cute! I made it immediately, but it's fun to make it so cute that I can't say anything about it.","72":"Cute minion\r\nI bought this because I liked Minion movies, I'm glad it was so cute","73":"I gave it to my grandchildren on Children's Day and was pleased.\r\nIt's a little difficult to assemble because I'm 4 years old, but I heard that I'm working with my parents little by little.\r\nIt seems that 4+ products are also in the lineup, but I chose this one according to my grandmother's taste.\r\nIt was good because I was able to purchase it by using points as soon as it was released.","74":"It's really cool\r\nI bought it because I wanted him.\r\nIt was a tremendous amount of parts, but when it was completed, it was really cool, and I thought it was amazing to be able to make small details properly.","75":"I gave it as a gift. There is little Lego block feeling, but it is very elaborate. Various parts are moving, and while making it, the recipient seems to have a lot of fun.","76":"I like the precise plastic model, but I also like the Lego blocks that capture the characteristics because of their cuteness and taste.\r\nI enjoyed it at my stay home.","77":"Run actively\r\nIt's a complexity that you can make on your own at the age of seven. The mechanics of Lego Technic? You can enjoy both the dynamic movement as a radio control and.","78":"I bought it for my son's Christmas present.\r\nSince it was the Christmas season, I was worried because the shipping notification was a little late, but it arrived safely.

I don't know about Lego at all, but I was very pleased ^ _ ^\r\nLego was an image of a building or town planning, but I was surprised that there were also motorcycles and cars. It's amazing that you can make anything by combining blocks! It's going to be a brain teaser, so I'd like to buy something affordable for myself next time ?","83":"A gift for acquaintances who like Lego and Harley! I personally wanted it, but it seems to be a limited edition, so I'm patient with one point. .. I would like you to be satisfied with the finished product ?","84":"I got it safely!\r\nI make it little by little every day and decorate it, but it's cool","85":"Arrived.\r\nIt arrived safely without the box being crushed.\r\nI want to finish it all at once, so I'll open it when I have time.\r\nI'm excited when to do it.","86":"6-year-old boy grandson's birthday gift\r\nHe gave his desired \"Lego\" as a birthday present for his grandson, a 6-year-old boy. I received a thank-you call immediately and was very pleased. He seems to be addicted to it lately, and I'm sure he will continue to challenge various things from now on. Thank you very much.","87":"I bought it for a child who is addicted to Jurassic World.\r\nI'm glad I could buy it because I don't sell much.","88":"I bought it for a child who is addicted to Jurassic World.\r\nI'm glad I could buy it because I don't sell much.","89":"It was a product as expected. I am very satisfied.","90":"It was packed tightly and the product box arrived cleanly. It was good because it was a gift. I still want to use it.","91":"This is amazing & # 8252;\r\nI ordered it on Monday of the release date and it arrived on Friday of that week. If you specify the date, it was the next Tuesday at the earliest, so I asked the shop to deliver it as soon as I could arrange it by canceling the date specification, but it was changed immediately, which was very helpful.\r\nWhen I took the cardboard that arrived, I was surprised at its weight. As expected it is about 3000 pieces. I opened the cardboard box and checked the box and contents of the product, but it was new without any problems. The box is also big, and just looking at the powerful picture will be a blissful time. There was another box in half the space inside the box, and the dinosaur and the gate bag were separated (the numbers are from 1 so there is no mistake). It's +16 LEGO, but I made it with my son in the third grade of elementary school. It took about 7 hours divided into 2 days by myself as a parts sorter and my son as an assembler. The biggest difficulty was sticking the Jurassic sticker. It's big and cut into a U shape, so I think it's difficult for children.\r\nLooking at the finished product again, the power was twice as powerful as I had imagined. Dinosaurs have long tails and big gates vertically! And messed up. To be honest, I thought that 40,000 including tax (the price at the time of release) was cheap. Currently, I am making a diorama suitable for this LEGO. I think it's a product that you can still enjoy even after you buy it, so I highly recommend it!","92":"I bought it thinking that it would be another pastime for children who only play games. I concentrated and completed it in about 2 hours.\r\nThe finished product is cute and I am satisfied with it.","93":"Satisfactory products created by both children and adults\r\nYou can make an out-of-print Dark Shark motif work with a model that follows the flow of the Nankai Hero series after a long time. I made it with my kids, but the kids enjoyed it and the adults got hooked.\r\nAccessories are also provided in the captain's room, kitchen, bar, etc., and attention is paid to details, and nearly 20 large and small dolls are included, which is a great deal.\r\nThere are many pieces, and the child created a completely original product with this product alone, or played with the Lego that he already had, and I think he was two birds with one stone.","94":"It's a very luxurious product and I think it's perfect as an object.","95":"I made it with excitement. In fact, I couldn't make a tree house, so it was fun.","96":"It arrived immediately after ordering. I couldn't go anywhere in Corona, and I was saved because there was no LEGO store nearby. Enjoy at home.","97":"I'm glad I didn't give up and contacted me.\r\nI found out about this product more than a week after its release, and when I searched for it, it was sold out everywhere, or the resale price was 2 to 3 times higher. I called the nearest physical store, but of course it was out of stock. I was about to start working on the potash, but when I contacted him with no reason, he answered that it was scheduled to arrive within an hour. After that, I checked it every day, and after 3 days, the stock was restored and I was able to get it at a fixed price. I am very satisfied.","98":"I made it with my daughter.\r\nAnyway, it's cute!\r\nIt's also good to move, not just decorate!\r\nThe price is a little expensive, but there is no loss in buying it.\r\nThe size is also reasonable.","99":"I've been worried about it for a year now, and I bought it because of the depression caused by Corona. It was also cheaper. I'm thinking of making it, but I'd like to see the package and heal it.","100":"The quality is high\r\nWhether you like Disney or Lego, you'll be very happy. After all, Lego has high quality and the price is reasonable. I think you should buy Lego, which is sometimes affordable, immediately. I have been buying it for a long time, but Lego over 10,000 yen is of high quality.","101":"For the first time ...\r\nSomehow, I wanted to make something with Lego, and I bought it because the color is monochrome, so I thought it was cute.\r\nI played with them when I was little, but it was my first time looking at the instructions.\r\nThe instruction manual is a large color illustration, so it is easy to understand, and it was completed in one day. it was fun.\r\nI want to make more.","102":"The gear is amazing!\r\nLEGO that is hard to see. I made it with my child for 2 hours. LEGO with interesting gimmicks that adults can enjoy.\r\nMiki Mini is also cute.","103":"I gave it to my son. It's fine to make with my 2-year-old daughter, so I'll make it a few years later. I really liked the product.","104":"I bought it as a birthday present for my grandson.\r\nI don't know the product because my birthday isn't there yet, but I said that I want a grandchild, so I set it to ? 5.","105":"My kid was addicted to the Jurassic World series and wanted dinosaur fossils to build Jurassic Park.\r\nIt seems that it was difficult because there were many white parts, but he explained that the tail could be moved and it was fun.\r\nThe scale is different from the Jurassic World series, so it's a little bigger, but I'm glad it was powerful.","106":"Was good.\r\nThe product and the correspondence of the shop were also good.\r\nI thought the quality was high for the price.","107":"I will make it a birthday present for my son who likes dinosaurs.\r\nI've always liked Lego and said, \"I wish I had a dinosaur fossil Lego,\" so\r\nI was happy when I found it. A happy face comes to my eyes.","108":"Bigger than I expected\r\nCompleted in a few hours while taking a break. I was satisfied because I could buy it at a fixed price.\r\nI choose a lot of places to decorate. Note\r\nthat the pedestal is just hooked, so\r\nif you put it on the way and work according to the production manual, it will fall and break.\r\nI wanted the solar panel to be expressed in blocks instead of printing.","109":"I bought it for my friend's child.\r\nThe impression is one word.\r\nVery small.\r\nIt was unexpected.\r\nBut kids will be happy!","110":"Children forget the time and are absorbed in making it! Thank you very much.","111":"I like this series because it's fun to use.","112":"I buy some small ones and make my own world of Minecraft.\r\nI think it's the one that is most likely to be Lego.","113":"I'm satisfied\r\nWe purchase for son of long temporary closure.\r\nI've been playing happily every day since it arrived.\r\nThey seem to like it very much and both parents and children are satisfied.","114":"Thank you very much. It is a birthday present for children. I can't go out in the corona, so & # 10071;","115":"I gave it as a gift to my nephew, but he was very pleased.","116":"For my son\r\nI bought it for my son who is stressed by the school closure. I love Minecraft so I was happy.","117":"I enjoy playing every day. The packaging was good and the delivery period was good.","118":"I love Minecraft.\r\nEvery birthday is Lego.\r\nWhen I added various items to the free shipping measures, I got a bonus.\r\nThank you very much.","119":"For Christmas gifts\r\nIt is purchased for grandchildren's Christmas gifts.\r\nI'm in a hurry if I don't buy the popular Lego before it runs out, so this time I just have to wait for Christmas.","120":"Christmas gift for my son in the first grade of elementary school\r\nPurchased at the request of my son, who usually loves block play.\r\nI've played some similar blocks, but I'm new to Lego.\r\nThe other day, I gave it as a Christmas present, and I was overjoyed and started making it silently.\r\nIt is difficult to assemble by yourself, and if an adult assists with \"Isn't this here?\" \"Is this part used?\" \"Is this part assembled differently?\", It will be assembled smoothly for 2 hours. Completed in about half.\r\nEven after it's completed, I've been having a lot of fun playing with TNT, playing adventures with figs, and more!\r\nIt was a very satisfying product for both adults and children!","121":"Purchased at the request of my nephew's Christmas gift. I was surprised at how big it was, but I'm looking forward to a happy face.","122":"For Christmas gifts\r\nWhen it arrived, I was surprised at the huge box. I can see the faces that make children happy.\r\nIt's also helpful to wrap it. Thank you very much.","123":"Christmas gift\r\nIt is for Christmas gifts for my 9-year-old son.\r\nI didn't open it, but it was fashionable with the LEGO tag on the Christmas wrapping.\r\nIt was very good that it was packed tightly.\r\nI'm looking forward to Christmas Eve.","124":"Very satisfied\r\nThe shipment was quick and the children were delighted.\r\nI immediately opened it, assembled it, and played with it.\r\nI am very satisfied with the purchase as well.","125":"It was delivered immediately after ordering! I was able to buy what my son wanted and it was a very good Christmas gift!","126":"I am happy to buy the Minecraft series that my child wanted at a great price.","127":"I bought it as a birthday present at the request of the person. I specified that I would arrive on the day of my birthday, but the shop called me that the shipping address was incorrect and the item was returned from the shipping address. It seems that it arrived safely thanks to the immediate response.\r\nThank you for responding as you wish while handling many products.","128":"Thank you for your transaction. If you have another chance, thank you.","129":"Reassembled many times\r\nTo a daughter who is addicted to both Lego and Minecraft.\r\nWhile looking at the instruction manual, I enjoyed assembling while saying that this is a block!\r\nIt seems that it is worth making if it is something I like, so I tried my best to assemble it.\r\nHow many times will it be?\r\nIt is disassembled and assembled repeatedly","130":"Grandson's request\r\nAt the request of my child, I gave it as a present during the New Year holidays","131":"I bought it because I forgot to buy it for Christmas because I was shopping online by myself.\r\nIt's out of season, but it's so cute!","132":"There are too many parts shortages.\r\nThere are too many parts shortages in recent LEGO ... If you order, it will be sent, but it will take time because it is from overseas \ufffd","133":"Beautiful set, but ..\r\nThis set has a beautiful facade and looks great with the other modular buildings. The birch tree to match Birch Books is a creative idea but the tree doesn't match well along side other modular buildings. It's also disappointing that the book store is so small And only one book (Moby Brick) included. I think a few unique books for this set would have made it better. The interior is nicely tiled; however, I wish LEGO would include some studded tiles for the floors so that we could pose some Figures In The Mini Buildings Without Them Falling Down.\r\nOverall The Design For This Set Is Wonderful And The Interior Is Very Cozy. There Is Also Easy Access To The Rooms From The Back Of The Building.","134":"Favorite after a long time\r\n\r\nThis is LEGO that I wanted after a long time .\r\nI'm looking forward to it!","135":"It was pretty good\r\nIt took two days for the child to make it at home. It was a pretty good finish. There was just one block. There are so many blocks that I couldn't confirm it at first, so it may have disappeared in the middle, but the details remain unknown.","136":"I can't go anywhere in Corona ... I enjoy it at home. It arrived immediately after ordering.","137":"Great\r\nI bought this product because I often stay at home as a measure against corona and have spare time.\r\nIt was my first time to buy Lego, but I liked making plastic models, so it was fun to assemble.\r\nThe Lego block accuracy is very high and it is well made.\r\nSince it also serves as a child-friendly manual, the assembly procedure was a manual with only pictures.\r\nHowever, please note that it may be read incorrectly.\r\nI made it according to the procedure, so I was able to do it in about 6 hours.\r\nSince the parts are small and large in quantity, it is better to color-code the parts and organize them before creating.\r\nIt was so much fun and I was able to concentrate, so I gave it 5 stars.\r\nI am looking forward to new projects in the future.","138":"Very satisfied\r\nI liked FIAT500 (Cinquecento) and bought it. It is well made and I am very satisfied.","139":"This is the third LEGO creator series.\r\nI found it during the stay home period, so I bought it immediately.\r\nIt's a waste to assemble in one day, so\r\nI enjoyed making it in three days.","140":"To father in his late 50s\r\nI sent it to my father who was lamenting that he would not do it on his own. I was very happy.\r\nThank you very much.","141":"I was able to spend a fulfilling time in my leisure time while refraining from corona. However, I felt that quality control was poor due to the lack of about 6 parts. You won't be able to return or exchange it while you're making it. The same was true when I bought the Mini Cooper before.","142":"Fun to make\r\nI liked 007 and bought it. It's cool.\r\nIt's nice to look at it and it's fun to skip the passenger seat.","143":"The best Lego ever.\r\nI've been interested in it for a long time, so I bought it. When completed, it is close to the actual car. In addition to the opening and closing action, I felt that the play response such as rear vehicle height adjustment and custom parts was worthy of satisfaction. This product is recommended not only for Lego lovers but also for car lovers.","144":"Nice set.\r\nThis is a very nice set with some interesting play features. A little expensive but it's LEGO so \ufffd","145":"I bought Lego for the first time.\r\nIt was difficult to find because there were many parts, but as I got used to it, it was fun to assemble.\r\nIt was the most difficult thing to distinguish the colors from the illustrations in the instruction manual.","146":"There is a response to the making, and the modeling is good.\r\nIt is an impression that I have finished making a series of car-related works of creator expert products.\r\n? Good points The\r\nnumber of pieces is much larger than others, and it is very satisfying to make. The shape is also good, so it is a satisfying product as a decoration.\r\nIt's also nice to be able to carry 32 minifigs, including the driver's seat and the audience seats.\r\n? Bad point\r\nThere are too many stickers anyway. It is almost impossible to paste it in the correct position without air bubbles. Small stickers can be reattached, but large stickers such as advertising posters are extremely difficult to reattach and cannot be reattached. I wanted this to be a printed part.\r\n? Precautions regarding production Make\r\nsure that there are no irregularities such as burrs on the surface of the advertising poster parts before attaching the sticker. It may cause the seal to rise.\r\nAlso, be careful not to confuse the top, bottom, left, and right of the sticker you are sticking.","147":"I'm not particularly dissatisfied with the product \ufffd","148":"There are many pieces, but I will make it little by little. I look forward to completion!","149":"I gave it to my friend who rides a motorcycle.\r\nI am very pleased and satisfied.","150":"Christmas gift\r\nI was worried that the product would be in time because my child had just decided on a Christmas gift from Santa, but it was saved because it was delivered in a short time.","151":"Cool!\r\nI bought it on the birthday of my 9-year-old LEGO-loving son. My hands are also dexterous, and if something of a normal level is too easy ,.\r\nThe box is big and there are many parts, the instructions are thick, it takes a day to complete, and if you make a mistake, it is difficult to look back, and it is said that it is the strongest and most difficult LEGO ever.\r\nOn my 8th birthday last year, I bought a radio-controlled model of LEGO Technic, but it took about 2 to 3 hours to finish.\r\nIt was interesting because of the gear and mechanical mechanism.\r\nIt's more of a mecha than a toy.\r\nIt's really cool.","152":"It seems to be difficult to create\r\nThe number of parts is large and it seems difficult to create, but I am looking forward to the workmanship of the technique.","153":"Not only the products but also the gifts were gorgeous! I'm looking forward to giving it to my birthday! !!","154":"We purchased for sons. I was happy that it became easier to aim. It seems that you can also enjoy a full-fledged mood. Due to my mistake, the shop took a lot of trouble twice, but he was kind and prompt. Thank you very much! If I had a product I wanted, I would like to purchase it again at your company. Thank you very much!","155":"I bought it at the request of my 4-year-old daughter. You shouldn't expect too much.","156":"Present for  People who use children for the  Number of purchases first time","157":"The packaging was solid, the batteries were in it, and it was ready to use, so the kids were very happy! It's an expensive purchase, but I'm glad I bought it!","158":"I have eight grandchildren, six girls and two boys. One three-year-old child wanted it and bought it, but other children also wanted it, so I ordered another one. But it's expensive. I hope it's cheaper.
